Install TIB/Rendezvous first.  See README.

To install Tibco::Rv:

One of: TIB_HOME, TIB_RV_HOME, or TIBRV_DIR must be set.
TIB_HOME must be your base Tibco directory, and it must contain "tibrv"; or:
TIB_RV_HOME or TIBRV_DIR must be your Rendezvous installation directory.  It
must contain "lib" and "include".

For instance, execute this command:

   $ export TIB_HOME=/usr/tibco

If you are building against a 6.x release of TIB/Rendezvous, you must do
the following in order to get Tibco::Rv to build properly:  In Rv.pm, change
the line "$TIBRV_VERSION_MAJOR = 7;" to "$TIBRV_VERSION_MAJOR = 6;".

Then, execute the following commands (use the proper version instead of "x.xx"):

   $ tar xvzf Tibco-Rv-x.xx.tar.gz
   $ cd Tibco-Rv-x.xx
   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install
