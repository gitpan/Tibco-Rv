Tibco::Rv


Tibco::Rv provides bindings and Object-Oriented classes for TIBCO's
TIB/Rendezvous message passing C API.  It should be used as a replacement
for the Perl bindings that ship with TIB/Rendezvous.

See LICENSE for copyright statement and licensing information.

You need to download and install TIB/Rendezvous separately, from:

TIBCO provides free copies of TIB/Rendezvous licensed for developer use only.
Other usage requires a purchased license.  See www.tibco.com for complete
information on TIB/Rendezvous licensing.

See INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install Tibco::Rv, especially
if you are building against a TIB/Rendezvous 6.x release.
