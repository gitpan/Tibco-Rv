Gotta do something to abstract out createInbox ...


Tibco::Rv::Msg::DateTime
doesn't seem to hold its nsec value ...  I think it's a bug w/tibrv


Tibco::Rv::Dispatcher::DESTROY
If idleTimeout is something other than WAIT_FOREVER or NO_WAIT, and that
idleTimeout is reached, then tibrvDispatcher_Destroy is called without
calling the Perl DESTROY method, putting the dispatcher in a bad state.  No
fix is contemplated.  So don't access a Dispatcher after it times out.
I'm also thinking that DESTROY will throw an exception when the Perl object
gets garbage collected in this situation.  But that's not really a big deal.


Tibco::Rv::Event::DESTROY
tibrvEvent_DestroyEx has a callback, but no closure data (unlike
tibrvQueue_DestroyEx -- I wonder why?).  Since Perl callbacks are stored
internally in the closure data, Tibco::Rv does not support the
tibrvEvent_DestroyEx callback.  It could be hacked in by storing the DESTROY
callback along with the onEvent callback in a hash or something, and passing
both callbacks into the Perl constructor.


tibrvMsg_SetHandlers
Not supported.  I'm sure no one wants this stuff, anyway.


tibrv 6.x support
Not tried.  Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't.
